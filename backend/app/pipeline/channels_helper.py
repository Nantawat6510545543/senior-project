"""Channel selection and optional µV range filtering utilities.

This module provides ChannelsHelper used by visualization utilities to:
- pick channels based on params.channels_list and showbad flag,
- optionally filter channels by complete-trace microvolt (µV) ranges,
- expose `picks` and `pick_names` for subsequent processing.
